      Eloquent Functions Exercises
    </h1>
    <h2>Minimum</h2>
    <p>
      1. Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their
      minimum.
    </p>
    <h2>Recursion</h2>
    <p>
      2. We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether
      a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two.
      Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or
      odd:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zero is even.</li>
      <li>One is odd.</li>
      <li>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The
      function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and
      return a Boolean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a
      way to fix this?
    </p>
    <h2>Bean Counting</h2>
    <p>
      3. You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing
      "string"[N]. The returned value will be a string containing only one
      character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which
      causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other
      words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have
      positions 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and
      returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there
      are in the string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except
      it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be
      counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite
      countBs to make use of this new function.
